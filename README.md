## AutoML Project

### Project Overview

This project is focused on automating the machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model training, optimization, and evaluation, for both **regression** and **classification** tasks. The project aims to streamline the model-building process and enable efficient hyperparameter tuning, with an emphasis on utilizing GPU to speed up computations.

#### Stages Involved:

1. **Data Collection**: Importing and organizing data from CSV and other data sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling, and transforming data to prepare it for model training.
3. **Model Training**: Applying regression and classification models using AutoML techniques with extensive hyperparameter tuning.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models based on performance metrics like R2 score (for regression), and accuracy (for classification).
5. **Optimization**: Using methods like Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization to enhance model performance.
6. **Deployment**: Saving the best-performing model and preparing it for real-time predictions.

### Installation
